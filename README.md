## Hello there👋
I’m Carlos, walking the path of a software engineer with the curiosity of a game designer and the heart of a community builder. Some days you’ll find me tuning shaders in Unity or sculpting worlds in Unreal; other days, I’m dissecting APIs and training models to make computers think a little more human.

When I’m not writing code, I’m the one in the red GitHub Campus Expert hoodie, sharing stories about open source, creativity, and why hackathons feel like home.

I believe in technology that feels alive — an AR story unfolding across city streets, a game world that learns from you, or a community that grows because it’s playful, not forced. If you want to talk AI agents, Gaussian splats, Unity prefabs, or how to build communities that feel like games, I’m always down.
