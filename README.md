### Hey thereðŸ‘‹

___

I am Carlos Mejia, a passionate computer science student currently hacking on various projects and exploring innovative tech solutions.

I love to work with augmented reality, game development, and web applications. Iâ€™m proficient in JavaScript, Java, Python, Swift, and TypeScript, and I enjoy experimenting with Unity, React.js, and Linux. Currently, I'm focused on pushing my skills in AI-driven applications and game mechanics.

As you might have guessed, Iâ€™m always curious about new tools and frameworks, especially in areas like Linux and design, and I enjoy diving into different programming languages and open-source projects.
